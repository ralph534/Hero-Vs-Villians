# Hero-Vs-Villian

Hey I have been working with React.js which is an all based Javascript library. I've been learning it for some time now, here I have create a hero vs villian app where you can choose and pic either one based on you prefernce and after each chocie the the images will randomly change to a different set. Its not much but its preety cool, here you can try it yourself.
